1. Explain what a variabel is:
A variable is a placeholder of information with an assigned value.
For example,
new_list = []
where new_list is the variable.

2.	Explain what a function is
A group of related statements that
performs a specific task when called upon.

3.	Explain what a program is
A program is a set of detailed instructions that a computer
executes and uses to perform a specific task.

4.	Explain what makes a program effective
5.	Explain what effective programming is
I will answer these two questions together as I feel like they
tie in to one another.
A program's effectiveness is obviously very much due to
how it is structured to try and utilize the least amount of
memory and processing time. Having that said, making sure the program
is reader-friendly could (should?) be deemed more important as
it aids with efficiency when it comes to adjusting/updating/altering
the program with the times.
Efficiency could also be down to how flexible a program is,
if you have to rewrite the entire structure every time changes need
to be made, that also slows down the effectiveness of the program.
As far as effective programming goes, I would say that writing
clear and well-documented code could sometimes be more efficient
than writing super advanced code that is hard for anyone
to read but to the writer. If no one understands your code apart
from yourself it just makes life hard for everyone in a bigger scale
project.
Also documenting your code properly so that other people can
understand (also for one self when returning to a project, perhaps
years later). This in itself aids to efficiency as you
might avoid having to spend hours trying to understand
what it is you have actually written.
